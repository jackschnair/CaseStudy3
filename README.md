# CaseStudy3

Jack Schnair's submission for case study 3.

The explanation of dataset and algorithm is in Case_Study_3.Rmd

The Shiny app is the CaseStudy3 subdirectory
There is a second csv in there that is a sanitized version of the file used in my explanation of the dataset.
It's in the same condition as it is when I sanitize it in the Rmd file.

The deployed app can be found here: https://posit.cloud/content/7242487
